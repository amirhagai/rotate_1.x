files that needed change in order to change image sizes of training data - 

/app/tools/data/dota/split/split_configs/ss_trainval.json
/app/tools/data/dota/split/split_configs/ss_test.json

after changes been made we need to run 

python tools/data/dota/split/img_split.py --base-json \
  tools/data/dota/split/split_configs/ss_trainval.json

python tools/data/dota/split/img_split.py --base-json \
  tools/data/dota/split/split_configs/ss_test.json

from the docker shell when we are at app directory


json fields 
sizes - images final size for rate = 1.0
gap - the steps of sliding widnows
rate - control in size, (rate = 0.5, size = 256) will result in (512, 512) images
image_rate_thr - the minimal rate of image in window and window'
iof_thr - the minimal iof between a object and a window


there are config files in which we can config stuff like atch size etc' (lr is not defined there)- 
(for example)

/app/configs/rotated_rtmdet/rotated_rtmdet_l-3x-dota.py

another important config files can be found at  

/app/configs/rotated_rtmdet/__base__

from running "/app/configs/rotated_rtmdet/rotated_rtmdet_l-3x-dota.py" i see that these files metters (    cfg = Config.fromfile(args.config) -> Config._get_base_files(temp_config_file.name))
['./_base_/default_runtime.py', './_base_/schedule_3x.py', './_base_/dota_rr.py']
